An Internet of Sex Toys experimental project.

## Quick start guide (WIP):
1. Acquire Intiface compatible end device (https://iostindex.com/?filter0ButtplugSupport=4) (Common brands include Lovense, Kiroo etc, though much cheaper options exist) (Only vibration supported for now)
2. Install Intiface Central (https://intiface.com/central/)
3. 3. Download the latest "bpio_x.x.x.zip" release from [github](https://github.com/Tomruler/beyondallbuttplug/releases/) and extract into Beyond-All-Reason/LuaUI/Widgets. If done correctly, you should find the beyond_all_buttplug.lua widget and bpio/ folder in Widgets/
4. Enable "Beyond All Buttplug" in the in-game settings.
5. Start Intiface and connect your chosen device
6. Run "bpio/bab_client.exe" and hit "Connect" on the GUI to link to Intiface. You should feel a quick pulse from your device.
7. Have Fun!
